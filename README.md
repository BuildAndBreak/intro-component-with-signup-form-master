## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript Vanilla

### What I learned

I'm really proud of what I’ve done because I went beyond what was required.
I didn’t just make the layout work well on different screen sizes, show hover effects for clickable elements, and add error messages when the form is submitted – I also added some extra features:

I made sure the password is validated with at least 6 characters, an uppercase letter, and a symbol.
I added a thumbs-up image when the user fills out a field correctly.
I made the whole thing more interactive by giving instant feedback on correct input.
These little extras really make the form feel more polished and user-friendly.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing in future projects by learning accessibility and Vanilla Javascript to have a better understanding of advanced concepts before I dive into React and other frameworks later.
I believe that with this knowledge I can become more versatile.

### Useful resources

-(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- This helped me to understand when I add an event listener to an element using the addEventListener() method, the function associated with the event remains active and will be called whenever the event occurs, without the need to call the function again.
